# Fyle Frontend Challenge

## Description
The page features a Git icon along with a search bar. Users can input their search query into the search bar and click on the search button. If there are no matching users, a skeleton screen will briefly display to represent the zero state. However, if a user is found, their details along with repository data will be displayed.

In the event that a user searches for special characters and there are no matches found, a message indicating "No user found" will be displayed below the search bar.

For responsive design, Tailwind CSS and media queries have been utilized. Additionally, ngx-pagination has been implemented for pagination functionality.

## Install requirements
* Install angular cli [Ref](https://angular.io/cli)
* `npm install` in this repository 
* if not works do this installation also `npm install ngx-pagination`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Testing server

Run `ng test` for unit testing. This command will open a new browser window with the heading "Karma v6.4.2 - connected; test: complete". In this window, you'll see information about the number of unit test cases passed and failed. If the window is blank or not displaying any information, stop both the Testing server and Development server, then restart the Testing server.
