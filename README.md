# Fyle Frontend Challenge

## Install requirements
* Install angular cli [Ref](https://angular.io/cli)
* `npm install` in this repository 
* if not works do this installation also `npm install ngx-pagination`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Testing server

Run `ng test` for unit testing. This command will open a new browser window with the heading "Karma v6.4.2 - connected; test: complete". In this window, you'll see information about the number of unit test cases passed and failed. If the window is blank or not displaying any information, stop both the Testing server and Development server, then restart the Testing server.
